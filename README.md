# ai-powered-planner
An AI-powered planning editor, similar to Cursor IDE but for general planning documents, predictively generates relevant sections like tech stacks, timelines, or resource lists as you write. It combines intelligent, context-aware suggestions with full user control, bridging the gap between passive writing assistants and rigid templates.
